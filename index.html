        <h2> Guess the dominant color</h2>
        <div> Every color can be written in RGB code, which has the form of
            (degree of red, degree of green, degree of blue). Your job is to guess
            which color has the highest "contribution" to a color that is randomly generated by our algorithm.
            In other words, you should guess which color is most dominant in a specific color we will show you.
